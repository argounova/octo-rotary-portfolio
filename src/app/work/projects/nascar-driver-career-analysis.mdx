## Overview

This project analyzes 76 years of NASCAR Cup Series data (1949-2025) to uncover driver career patterns and predict future performance using advanced machine learning techniques. Starting with 99,500+ race records from the nascaR.data package, the analysis employs K-means clustering to identify six distinct driver archetypes and LSTM neural networks to predict career trajectories. The project features a complete full-stack implementation with Python-based machine learning models, a FastAPI backend, and an interactive Next.js frontend dashboard. Currently in active development, the application demonstrates the end-to-end data science workflow while continuing to evolve with bug fixes and enhanced functionality.

## Challenges and Learnings

The primary challenge involved designing an effective feature engineering pipeline that captures career progression patterns while avoiding data leakage in time series predictions. Creating meaningful driver archetypes required careful selection of clustering features and hyperparameter tuning to balance cluster interpretability with statistical significance. The LSTM model architecture needed optimization to handle variable-length career sequences while maintaining prediction accuracy across different career stages. Integrating machine learning models with a production web application required careful consideration of model serialization, API design, and real-time prediction serving. Building intuitive visualizations that effectively communicate complex clustering results and neural network predictions to diverse audiences demanded iterative design refinement and user experience testing.

## Outcome

This project successfully demonstrates the complete machine learning workflow from data acquisition through model deployment, showcasing both unsupervised learning (clustering) and supervised learning (LSTM prediction) techniques applied to sports analytics. The clustering analysis reveals meaningful driver archetypes that align with NASCAR domain expertise while providing quantitative validation of intuitive career patterns. The LSTM models show promising results for career trajectory prediction, though ongoing refinement continues to improve accuracy and interpretability. The full-stack implementation proves the viability of serving complex machine learning models through modern web applications. As development continues, future iterations will focus on model performance optimization, enhanced visualization capabilities, and expanded predictive features to create a comprehensive NASCAR analytics platform.
