## Overview

A fully responsive developer portfolio showcasing personal and professional work across web, data, and 3D domains, built using Next.js with a focus on maintainability and performance.

## Key Features

- **Markdown-Based Content Management**: Portfolio projects are written in Markdown and parsed with gray-matter, allowing for fast updates without touching component code.
- **Responsive, Thematic UI**: Styled using MUI, Emotion, and custom fonts, the UI adapts fluidly across breakpoints while maintaining a consistent visual identity.
- **Interactive Animations**: Framer Motion is used to add subtle transitions and page animations that enhance interactivity without compromising load time.
- **Client-Side Email Handling**: EmailJS handles form submission directly from the browser, eliminating the need for a custom backend or API route.
- **Component Reusability & Scalability**: Custom card layouts and dynamic routing allow new projects to be added with minimal configuration, promoting scalability.

## Technologies Used

- **Gray Matter**: Parsed Markdown files for project metadata and content, enabling a blog-style system without a CMS.
- **Next.js**: Provided hybrid static/server-side rendering and routing for a performant and SEO-aware structure.
- **React.js**: Powered the component architecture and dynamic state management for smooth interactivity.
- **Emotion + MUI**: Enabled custom theming and responsive layout using styled components integrated with Material UI.
- **Framer Motion**: Added lightweight animation transitions across routes and UI elements for a polished user experience.

## Challenges and Learnings

Integrating Emotion with MUI required fine-tuning theme inheritance and resolving styling conflicts during SSR. Setting up a Markdown-based content pipeline was initially error-prone, but it significantly streamlined content updates once established. Balancing animation performance with responsiveness taught me how to optimize motion values and limit unnecessary re-renders. The experience also reinforced best practices around accessibility and semantic structure within animated UIs.

## Outcome

The result is a fast, flexible, and easily maintainable portfolio site that showcases a variety of projects without repetitive coding. It serves as a working demonstration of both my technical stack and my approach to scalable front-end architecture and design systems.
