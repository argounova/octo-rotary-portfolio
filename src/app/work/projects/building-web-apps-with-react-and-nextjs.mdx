## Overview

Development of a flexible and highly customizable website using Next.js for front-end, Material UI and Emotion Styling, and Email.js for visitor data capture and communication.

## Key Features

- **Component Library**: Built a set of modular, reusable UI components using React and styled-components in Next.js, focusing on accessibility and responsiveness.
- **Theming and Customization**: Integrated a theming system that allows easy switching and customization of color palettes, typography, and layout styles using CSS variables.
- **Email.JS**: Implemented client-side email handling via EmailJS, eliminating backend dependencies.
- **Framer Motion**: Leveraged Framer Motion for performant, declarative UI animations.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, Emotion, MUI, Email.js.
- **Backend**: Next.js, API Routes, Node.js.
- **Deployment**: Vercel.

## Challenges and Learnings

Building a dynamic site with Next.js and React required careful coordination between server-side rendering and client-side interactivity. Implementing Framer Motion alongside Emotion and Material UI presented styling conflicts and performance considerations, which taught me how to scope styles effectively and optimize animations for responsiveness. Structuring reusable components while maintaining accessibility and theme consistency helped refine my design system thinking. Deploying and testing across devices emphasized the importance of mobile-first design and load performance tuning.

## Outcome

The result was a responsive, visually engaging website that showcases interactive animations and a clean UI, delivering a smooth user experience across platforms. The project reinforced my ability to build scalable front-end systems with modern styling and animation tools.
