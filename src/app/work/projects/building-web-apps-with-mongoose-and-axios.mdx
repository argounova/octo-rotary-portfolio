## Overview

Development of a flexible and highly customizable website using Next.js for front-end, Figma for design collaboration, and MongoDB to house data.

## Key Features

- **Component Library**: Built a set of modular, reusable UI components using React and styled-components in Next.js, focusing on accessibility and responsiveness.
- **Theming and Customization**: Integrated a theming system that allows easy switching and customization of color palettes, typography, and layout styles using CSS variables.
- **MongoDB Integration**: Dynamic content fetched and persisted through Axios/Mongoose integration.
- **User Portals**: Secure login system using NextAuth with session management.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, Styled Components, MUI, Figma.
- **Database**: MongoDB (cloud-hosted via MongoDB Atlas).
- **Backend**: Next.js, API Routes, Node.js.
- **Connectivity**: Axios (client-side), Mongoose (server-side).
- **Deployment**: Vercel.

## Challenges and Learnings

Integrating NextAuth with a cloud-hosted MongoDB instance required careful session management and schema alignment, which deepened my understanding of authentication flows and security best practices. Managing asynchronous data fetching across both client and server sides helped me sharpen my skills in using Axios and structuring Next.js API routes. Additionally, building a mobile-responsive UI from scratch gave me hands-on experience in creating adaptable layouts and reusable components.

## Outcome

The project resulted in a fully functional, responsive full-stack application with secure user login and dynamic data handling. It reinforced my ability to build scalable web apps and demonstrated my proficiency in managing authentication, state, and responsive designâ€”all of which I now apply to more advanced projects.
