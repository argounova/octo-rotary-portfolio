## Overview

This single-page application was created as part of a digital brand kit experiment, where a fictional DJ character was developed using generative AI. The site leverages dark neon styling and microinteractions to deliver a modern, immersive user experience. It serves both as a live design artifact and a proof-of-concept for merging AI-generated assets with interactive web development.

## Key Features

- **Custom Dark UI Theme**: Applied a neon-inspired MUI theme for a striking, consistent visual aesthetic.
- **Audio Player Integration**: Embedded music playback component to simulate a DJ sample reel.
- **Interactive Booking Form**: Built with MUI inputs and styled for UX clarity, supporting mock submissions.
- **Smooth Animations**: Utilized Framer Motion for page-level transitions and section entrances.
- **Responsive Layout**: Designed with Tailwind CSS and MUI Grid to ensure cross-device compatibility.

## Technologies Used

- **React 19**: Powered component structure and client-side rendering.
- **TypeScript**: Enforced type safety and improved code reliability across components.
- **Vite**: Enabled fast, modern development and build pipeline.
- **Material UI (v7)**: Provided customizable components and dark theme support.
- **Figma**: Created visual assets and layout wireframes for brand consistency.
- **Fooocus**: Generated AI-based character art and visual assets using Stable Diffusion.

## Challenges and Learnings

Balancing two styling systems (MUI and Tailwind) while maintaining responsive design required careful class management and custom theme overrides. Integrating an audio player with clean state handling introduced timing edge cases between React rendering and media loading. Additionally, deploying to Vercel demanded proper suspense boundaries for async rendering compatibility.

## Outcome

The final product is a fast-loading, visually distinctive landing page that merges creative AI outputs with modern front-end engineering. It effectively showcases how brand identity, motion design, and functional interaction can come together in a single-page app tailored for digital personas.
